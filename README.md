# TDD Connect Four

## Introduction

Welcome to the TDD Connect Four project! In this project, you'll be building the classic game Connect Four using Ruby and the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping pieces into a grid, aiming to get four of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to implement the Connect Four game in a command-line interface while applying TDD principles. You'll write tests first, then implement the code to pass those tests, ensuring your game is robust and well-tested.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Players alternate turns to drop pieces into the grid.
- **Win Condition**: The game checks for four consecutive pieces in a row, column, or diagonal to declare a winner.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game runs in the terminal, allowing players to input their moves.
- **Unicode Symbols**: Optionally, use Unicode symbols to represent game pieces for a more visually appealing experience.

## Assignment Steps

1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Create a new Ruby project.
   - Set up RSpec for testing.

2. **Implement TDD**:
   - Identify the core functionalities of the game (e.g., dropping pieces, checking for a win, switching turns).
   - Write failing tests for each functionality.
   - Implement the code to pass the tests.
   - Refactor the code to improve readability and performance.
   
3. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement the logic for dropping pieces into the grid.
   - Check for a win condition in rows, columns, and diagonals.
   - Ensure the game handles edge cases, such as full columns.

4. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Create a user-friendly interface for players to input their moves.
   - Display the game board after each move.
   - Announce the winner or declare a draw if the board is full.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-four.git
   cd connect-four```
   
2. **Install Dependancies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install```
   
3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
 rspec```

4. **Play the game**:
   ```bash
 ruby lib/connect_four.rb```

## Learning Objectives

- **Test-Driven Development**: Gain proficiency in TDD by writing tests before implementing functionality.
- **RSpec**: Learn to write and run tests using the RSpec testing framework.
- **Ruby Programming**: Enhance your Ruby programming skills by building a complete game.
- **Problem-Solving**: Develop problem-solving skills by breaking down the game logic into manageable parts and writing tests for each part.

## Conclusion

This project is an excellent opportunity to practice TDD while building a fun and interactive game. By following the TDD approach, i ensure your code is well-tested and maintainable. I enjoyed the process of building Connect Four and showcasing my skills in Ruby and TDD!
